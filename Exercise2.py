# 1. Candy or Bowtie
# Write a program that draws a candy or a bowtie, given the following user specifications:
# - candy (c) or bowtie (b)
# - width (even or odd integer)
# - tight or relaxed pattern (default is tight, see first two diagrams)

##Function for reverse traingle

# 2. Boolean expressions. Do not use conditionals.
# a. Write a function is_leapyear() that returns True if a year is a leap year, and False otherwise. A leap year is
# divisible by 400 or by 4 but not by 100.

year = int(input("Enter year"))

# consonant

# 4. Shuffle
    # Write a program that reads a sentence from the command line as a list of strings and returns the sentence in a shuffled
    # order. The strings in the list need to change positions in place: do not create a duplicate list

# 5. Pascal candy
# Write a program that prompts the user for an integer and builds and prints the equivalent Pascal candy. In a Pascal
# candy, every row may be computed from the previous row by adding adjacent pairs of values together. Using a two
# dimensional list (list of lists), Pascalâ€™s rule stipulates that, for any non-negative integer n and any integer k, between 0
# and n, inclusive: a[n][k] = a[n-1][k-1] + a[n-1][k].

            row.extend([sum(pair) for pair in zip(lastRow, lastRow[1:])])

# 6. Student Records
# Students have been registered in the Computer Science program on a first come, first served basis. But now that the
# dust has settled, the administration wants to sort the student records in alphabetical order. Each student record is a
# tuple consisting of the following information: (last name, first name, Month-of-birth, Year-of-birth). Write a function
# that return a sorted list of tuples on last name, first name, year, then month. 

t = [("last name","Tauriac"),("first name","Rose"),("Month of birth",1),("year of birth",1910)]
temp = t[2]
temp1 =t[3]
t[2]=temp1
t[3]=temp 
print(t)

# 7. Word Frequency
# a. Write a function called word_frequencies(myList) that accepts a list of strings called myList and returns a
# dictionary where the keys are the words from myList and the values are the number of times that word appears
# in myList.

mylist = ["apple","organe","banana","apple","papple","apple","banana"]
def frequencies(mylist):
    myDictonray = {}
    for x in mylist:
        myDictonray[x] = mylist.count(x)
    return myDictonray

myD = {};
myD = frequencies(mylist)
print(myD)


# b. Write a function to invert key and value pairs in the dictionary you constructed. Sort the dictionary according 
# to the new keys. The function should accept a dictionary as parameter and return a tuple with the most frequent word 
# and its frequency.

invert = {}
for k,v in myD.items():
    invert[v] = k
print(invert)

def sortedDict(arr):
    return [(k,arr[k]) for k in sorted(arr.keys())]
